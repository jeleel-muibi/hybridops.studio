VIDEO SCRIPT:


[INTRO - 00:00]
Welcome to HybridOps.Studio. In this video, we showcase the Gen Inventory Role ‚Äî a powerful Ansible automation tool designed for hybrid cloud environments. If you're managing multi-site infrastructure and care about governance, security, and compliance, you're in the right place.

[WHY IT MATTERS - 00:30]
Manual inventory management is error-prone and risky. This role automates inventory generation with zero IP exposure, consistent host naming, and full audit compliance. It's part of the Environment Guard Framework pipeline.

[QUICK START - 01:00]
To get started, run:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i localhost, tests/test_role.yml -e env=dev
```
This generates a dynamic inventory for your environment using placeholder IPs.

[ARCHITECTURE - 01:30]
The role scans your project root, validates the environment, and loads IP mappings dynamically. It supports global deployments ‚Äî Tokyo, Lagos, and beyond ‚Äî with redundancy awareness.

[FEATURES - 02:00]
- Governance integration
- Security abstraction
- Multi-site support
- Redundancy awareness
- Zero IP leakage

[SECURITY MODEL - 02:30]
Inventories use placeholder IPs like XX.XX.XX.00. Real IPs are resolved at runtime, ensuring no sensitive data is stored in Git.

[DEMO - 03:00]
Let‚Äôs run the role test and inspect the output:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i localhost, tests/test_role.yml
```
You‚Äôll see generated files like:
```ini
[cisco_routers]
coreR-1-Tok ansible_host=XX.XX.XX.00
```

[PIPELINE CONTEXT - 04:00]
This role integrates with:
- env_guard
- ip_mapper
- host_selector
- connectivity_test

[WRAP-UP - 04:30]
