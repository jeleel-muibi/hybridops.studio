HybridOps.Studio ‚Äî Environment Guard Framework (EGF)
Host Selector + IP Mapper Showcase

==== VIDEO SCRIPT ====

TITLE CARD (0:00‚Äì0:05)
On-screen: "HybridOps.Studio | EGF: Host Selector + IP Mapper"
B-roll: Terminal + topology diagram fade-in.
Voiceover (VO): "In this video, we‚Äôll turn enterprise host selection into a governed, auditable workflow‚Äîend to end."

HOOK (0:05‚Äì0:12)
On-screen: "Governed. Auditable. Pipeline-ready."
VO: "Pick targets safely, map them to live IPs, and prove it with correlation IDs‚Äîfast."

INTRO (0:12‚Äì0:45)
VO: "Hey, it‚Äôs Jeleel from HybridOps.Studio. Today we‚Äôll showcase the Host Selector and IP Mapper pieces of the Environment Guard Framework. You‚Äôll see how we validate the environment, select hosts four different ways, resolve IPs dynamically, and verify results with clean failure paths and audit-grade logging."

AGENDA (0:45‚Äì1:00)
‚Ä¢ Prerequisite checks & CID seeding
‚Ä¢ Selection methods A‚ÄìD
‚Ä¢ Dynamic IP mapping
‚Ä¢ Validation & error handling
‚Ä¢ Smoke test and outputs

SECTION 1 ‚Äî PREREQUISITES & CID (1:00‚Äì2:10)
VO: "We start by validating that governance has run and seeding a correlation ID (CID) for traceability. The role asserts that a validated environment and correlation_id exist, then builds a working target list from either explicit targets, previously selected hosts, or all inventory."
On-screen (terminal):
  ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev tests/test_role.yml -e "validated_env=dev"
Callout: "CID logging is on by default; disable via host_selector_use_cid: false"

SECTION 2 ‚Äî HOST SELECTION METHODS (2:10‚Äì6:30)
VO: "The Host Selector supports four methods:"
  ‚Ä¢ Method A ‚Äî Manual entry: provide comma-separated hostnames/IPs.
  ‚Ä¢ Method B ‚Äî Group selection: pick one or more inventory groups from a readable list.
  ‚Ä¢ Method C ‚Äî Hierarchical browsing: navigate categories like Network, Compute, Monitoring, or Geography.
  ‚Ä¢ Method D ‚Äî All hosts: bulk operations across infrastructure.
On-screen: prompts and examples of each method, including group menus and 1-based selection.
Tip: "Validated environment is mandatory‚Äîselection is blocked if env_guard hasn‚Äôt set it."

SECTION 3 ‚Äî DYNAMIC IP MAPPING (6:30‚Äì8:15)
VO: "With hosts selected, we resolve ansible_host dynamically from environment-specific mappings. The play iterates your group memberships, extracts the right mapping for the current environment, and sets ansible_host accordingly. Successfully mapped inventory hostnames are tracked for reporting."
On-screen (terminal):
  ansible-playbook roles/ip_mapper/tasks/set_ansible_host.yml

SECTION 4 ‚Äî VALIDATION & AUDIT TRAIL (8:15‚Äì9:50)
VO: "We then validate the mapping. Any hosts that remain without an ansible_host are reported, and if none mapped at all, the run fails with a clear message. All messages include the same CID to keep your run traceable end-to-end."

SECTION 5 ‚Äî SMOKE TEST & OUTPUTS (9:50‚Äì11:10)
VO: "A smoke test asserts that hosts were selected and that the dynamic group targets_to_ping exists. You‚Äôll also see the correlation ID echoed, so you can tie logs together across the pipeline."
On-screen (terminal):
  ansible-playbook tests/test_role.yml -e "validated_env=staging method=D"
Expected: "Host selection successful: <N> hosts selected"

WRAP-UP (11:10‚Äì12:00)
VO: "You‚Äôve seen governed host selection, dynamic IP mapping, and auditable validation. In the next video, we‚Äôll plug in connectivity tests and deployment. If this was helpful, like, subscribe, and check the links below."

==== YOUTUBE DESCRIPTION (SEO-Optimized) ====

Title: EGF Host Selector + IP Mapper ‚Äî Governed Targeting, Dynamic IPs, Audit-Ready (hybridops.studio)

Learn how to build **enterprise-grade host selection** with **governance and auditability** in the Environment Guard Framework (EGF). We validate prerequisites, select targets four ways (manual, groups, hierarchical, all), **map IPs dynamically** per environment, and **verify results** with clean failure paths and correlation IDs (CID).
