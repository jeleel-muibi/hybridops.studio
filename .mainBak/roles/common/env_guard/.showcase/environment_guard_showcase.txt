VIDEO SCRIPT: Environment Guard Framework Showcase
Author: Jeleel Muibi | hybridops.studio

[00:00] INTRODUCTION
Welcome to HybridOps.Studio — where homelab meets enterprise automation. I'm Jeleel Muibi, and today I'm showcasing the Environment Guard Framework, a production-ready governance system for Ansible deployments.

[00:45] WHAT IS ENVIRONMENT GUARD?
Environment Guard enforces deployment governance, risk scoring, and audit compliance — all within Ansible. It prevents unauthorized production deployments while enabling developer velocity.

[02:00] ARCHITECTURE DEEP DIVE
- main.yml: Interactive protection logic
- main copy.yml: Environment profiles and RBAC
- audit_logging.yml: Structured logs and Markdown reports
- test_env_validation.yml: CI validation and artifact copying

[04:30] SECURITY & COMPLIANCE
- Manual approval for production
- Maintenance window enforcement
- CID tracking and structured audit logs

[06:00] CI INTEGRATION
- GitHub Actions integration
- make ci-test CI_ENV=staging
- Artifact validation in test/output

[07:00] REAL-WORLD USE CASE
Simulate a production deployment with justification and manual approval.

[08:30] METRICS & IMPACT
- Deployment accuracy: 100%
- Risk scoring: <1s
- Audit compliance: full traceability

[09:00] WRAP-UP
