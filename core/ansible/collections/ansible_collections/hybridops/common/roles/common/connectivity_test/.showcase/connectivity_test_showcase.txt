[INTRO - 00:00]
Welcome to HybridOps Studio! I'm Jeleel Muibi, and today we're showcasing the Environment Guard Framework ‚Äî your enterprise-grade connectivity test harness.

[OVERVIEW - 00:20]
This framework validates network connectivity across ICMP, SSH, Telnet, HTTP, and HTTPS protocols. It integrates seamlessly with governance workflows and generates structured JSON and JSONL reports.

[PIPELINE FLOW - 01:00]
The pipeline includes env_guard ‚Üí gen_inventory ‚Üí host_selector ‚Üí ip_mapper ‚Üí connectivity_test ‚Üí deployment. Each stage ensures traceability and compliance.

[DEMO - 02:00]
We'll run the test harness using test_role.yml. Watch as we execute per-host tests, compile results, and save them centrally.

[ARTIFACTS - 03:30]
Artifacts are saved in JSON and JSONL formats, with metadata and symlink updates for CI/CD compatibility.

[VALIDATION - 04:30]
We validate the central artifacts and optionally copy them for evidence. This ensures audit readiness and governance alignment.

[WRAP-UP - 05:30]
Thanks for watching! Subscribe to HybridOps Studio for more enterprise automation insights.
