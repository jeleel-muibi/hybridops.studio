✅ How to Present This in Your Portfolio

README Highlights
-----------------
Use concise bullets under a section like "What This Demonstrates":
- Dynamic environment mapping with zero hardcoded IPs.
- Zero IP exposure: secure host resolution.
- Preflight connectivity validation with JSON/CSV artifacts.
- CI/CD integration with status badge.

🎥 Demo Video (5–7 mins)
------------------------
Structure the flow for clarity:
1. Show `hosts.ini` placeholders (no IPs).
2. Run `ip_mapper` pre-play to resolve dynamic IPs.
3. Execute `connectivity_test` and open `test_logs/*.{json,csv,jsonl}`.
4. Show GitHub Actions run → download artifacts → highlight governance.

📝 Blog Post
-----------
Title: "Enterprise‑Grade Connectivity Checks in Governed Pipelines"
Include:
- Why this matters in enterprise CI/CD.
- Key snippets (Ansible tasks, JSON logs).
- Diagrams: flow of IP mapping → connectivity test → artifact storage.

📂 Evidence Pack
---------------
Bundle:
- Repo link (with README).
- CI/CD run screenshots or public badge.
- Demo video link.
- Sample artifacts (JSON, CSV).

Why This Enhancement Works
--------------------------
- Action verbs make it portfolio-ready.
- Recruiter-friendly framing: focuses on governance, security, and automation.
- Evidence pack shows completeness (code + automation + proof).
