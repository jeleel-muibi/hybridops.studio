[SECTION 1] VIDEO SCRIPT
Title Card (0:00–0:05)
  • On-screen text: "EGF: Ansible Host Selector — 4 Methods, Zero‑Risk Targeting"
  • Subtext: "hybridops.studio"
  • SFX: subtle whoosh; background pulse.

Hook (0:05–0:20)
  • Presenter (to camera): "Can your playbook target only the right hosts, every time? Today I’ll show you a Host Selector that adds governance, validation, and four selection methods to your Ansible workflows."

Intro & Value (0:20–0:50)
  • Lower-third: "hybridops.studio"
  • Key points:
    – 4 selection methods: Manual, Group-based, Hierarchical, All Hosts.
    – Governance-aware: uses validated environment & correlation ID from the EGF pipeline.
    – Outputs a dynamic group (targets_to_ping) for downstream tasks.

Agenda (0:50–1:00)
  • What you’ll see: quick architecture → demo each method → CID traceability → summary & next steps.

Architecture (1:00–1:40)
  • Visual: simple pipeline flow
    env_guard → host_selector → dynamic groups → next roles
  • Narration: "env_guard validates the environment and seeds correlation ID. host_selector handles input, expands hosts, and creates a dynamic group for the rest of the pipeline."

Prerequisites (1:40–2:00)
  • Ansible installed; working inventory; access to the role.
  • A validated environment value (e.g., dev/staging/prod) from env_guard or passed via extra-vars.

Demo Setup (2:00–2:30)
  • Terminal: open the test playbook.
  • Command (interactive run):
    ansible-playbook tests/test_role.yml -i tests/inventory/test_inventory.ini

Method A — Manual Entry (2:30–3:30)
  • Prompt appears: "Enter IPs/hostnames (comma-separated)".
  • Enter: 172.16.10.10, server01.local
  • Role normalizes and validates input; invalid formats fail fast.
  • Show debug: "Accepted N target(s)…"

Method B — Group Names (3:30–4:30)
  • Prompt lists available groups in 3 columns; enter valid group names.
  • The role validates group existence, then expands to hosts.
  • Show debug with groups → host count.

Method C — Hierarchical Browse (4:30–5:30)
  • Menu: select a category by number, then a group.
  • The role resolves the selected group to hosts.

Method D — All Hosts (5:30–6:15)
  • The role flattens all category groups, warns on any missing groups, and selects all matching hosts.

Dynamic Group Creation (6:15–6:45)
  • The role creates a runtime group named targets_to_ping and sets selection facts.

CID & Summary (6:45–7:10)
  • Show log line with [cid=…] and the summary message.

Next Steps (7:10–7:30)
  • Hand off targets_to_ping to connectivity tests, deployments, etc.
  • Subscribe & follow links below.

TITLE
EGF: Ansible Host Selector — 4 Methods, Zero‑Risk Targeting | hybridops.studio

DESCRIPTION
Build enterprise‑grade host targeting into your Ansible pipeline. In this hands‑on demo, I showcase the Environment Guard Framework (EGF) Host Selector with four selection methods (Manual, Group, Hierarchical, All Hosts), governance‑aware environment validation, and dynamic grouping for downstream tasks. You’ll learn how the role normalizes input, prevents mistakes, and emits a runtime group (targets_to_ping) you can pass to tests and deployments.

WHAT YOU’LL LEARN
• How to run the Host Selector test playbook
• When to use Methods A, B, C, and D
• How environment validation & correlation ID (CID) improve traceability
• How the role creates the targets_to_ping group for pipelines

COMMANDS USED
Interactive:
  ansible-playbook tests/test_role.yml -i tests/inventory/test_inventory.ini
Non‑interactive (CI/CD):
  ansible-playbook tests/test_role.yml -i tests/inventory/test_inventory.ini -e "validated_env=staging correlation_id=ci-run-12345 method=D"
