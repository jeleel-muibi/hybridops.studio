HybridOps.Studio – Ansible Collections vs Roles (Reminder)

1) Download counters
- Role install:
  ansible-galaxy role install mynamespace.myrole
  -> Increments ONLY that role’s download count.

- Collection install:
  ansible-galaxy collection install mynamespace.mycollection
  -> Increments ONLY that collection’s download count.
  -> Roles inside the collection do NOT get separate role-download stats.

2) What this means for HybridOps
- Modern best practice is to publish Ansible CONTENT as COLLECTIONS.
- It’s OK (and good) if most usage shows up as “collection downloads” only.
- Focus on making the collection the product, not chasing per-role stats.

3) Recommended strategy
- Primary artifacts:
  - hybridops.core
  - hybridops.proxmox
  - hybridops.kubernetes
  (etc., as the project grows)

- Inside each collection, provide roles, e.g.:
  - hybridops.core.env_guard
  - hybridops.core.gen_inventory
  - hybridops.proxmox.packer_templates
  - hybridops.kubernetes.k3s_lab

- Public install pattern (docs, academy, YouTube):
  ansible-galaxy collection install hybridops.core

4) KPI mindset
- Treat “collection download count” as the main public metric.
- Show it in portfolio / docs screenshots as:
  “HybridOps.Core — <N>+ downloads (multi-role collection)”

5) Optional “front door” role (only if needed)
- You COULD publish a single legacy role (e.g. hybridops.bootstrap_lab)
  that depends on your collections for discoverability.
- But it’s not required for good practice or for assessors/hiring managers.
