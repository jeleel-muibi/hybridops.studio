# üöÄ Deployment Automation Suite

Welcome to the **Deployment Automation Suite** ‚Äî your one-stop shop for deploying and managing infrastructure across multiple environments and platforms. This folder is organized for clarity, efficiency, and professional portfolio presentation.

## üì¶ Structure Overview

```
deployment/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ linux/        # Linux deployment scripts & tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ windows/      # Windows deployment scripts & tools
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ network/      # Network automation scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ kubernetes/   # Kubernetes deployment scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ inventory/    # Env-specific inventories/configs
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ common/       # Shared helpers/utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ orchestrate_all.sh # Master orchestration script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # (this file)
```

- **Each folder** contains scripts targeting a specific platform or environment.
- **No per-folder READMEs:** This document is the central source of deployment documentation.
- **Every script** contains a detailed header at the top covering purpose, usage, arguments, examples, and author.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Make Scripts Executable

```bash
chmod +x linux/*.sh network/*.sh kubernetes/*.sh common/*.sh orchestrate_all.sh
```
(Adjust for `*.ps1` or other extensions as needed.)

### 2. Run a Deployment Script

Navigate to the relevant subfolder and run the script, specifying the environment (`dev`, `staging`, `prod`, etc.):

```bash
cd linux
./deploy.sh dev
```

Or run the master orchestrator from the root:

```bash
./orchestrate_all.sh prod
```

> **Tip:** All scripts require the target environment as a command-line argument. If omitted, you'll see usage instructions from the script header.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- **Inventory Management:**
  Scripts use or generate inventory/config files from `inventory/` for the chosen environment.

- **Playbook & Script Execution:**
  Each deploy script (shell, PowerShell, etc.) executes the right automation playbooks (Ansible, etc.) and logic for the target platform.

- **Secrets/Vault Handling:**
  If using Ansible Vault or similar, you'll be prompted for secrets if needed. See each script header for specifics.

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **Permission Denied:**
  Scripts must be executable:
  `chmod +x <script>`

- **Missing Arguments:**
  Scripts will exit and display usage instructions if required arguments are missing.

- **Other issues?**
  See the script header for dependencies, known issues, and advanced options.

## üåü Best Practices

- Use only these scripts for deployment to ensure all prerequisites and steps are followed.
- Source shared helpers from `common/` in your scripts as needed (see script headers).
- Keep code and documentation up to date. Update this README if the high-level structure changes.
- For any new script, include a standard header describing usage, author, and options.
