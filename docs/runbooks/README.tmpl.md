# Runbooks — Operational Procedures

Concise, reproducible procedures for DR, burst, bootstrap, DNS cutover, VPN, secrets rotation, and related operations.  
Each runbook is outcome-focused and linked to supporting evidence.

> Access flags (`public`, `premium`, `mixed`) follow the documentation access model in [ADR-0021](../adr/ADR-0021-docs-access-model.md).

## Conventions (applies to all runbooks)

- **Pre-checks** — prerequisites and environment sanity.
- **Execute** — ordered steps and commands.
- **Verify** — success criteria and dashboards to check.
- **Artifacts** — logs and exports to capture under `output/`.
- **Rollback** — safe, minimal reversal steps.
