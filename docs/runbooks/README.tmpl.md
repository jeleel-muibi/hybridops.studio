# Runbooks — Operational Procedures

Concise, reproducible procedures for DR, burst, bootstrap, DNS cutover, VPN, secrets rotation, and more.
Each runbook is outcome‑focused and linked to evidence.

> The list below is generated from the runbooks in this folder. For update details, see the [Maintenance Guide](../maintenance.md#runbooks-generator).

## Conventions (applies to all runbooks)
- **Pre-checks** — prerequisites and environment sanity.
- **Execute** — ordered steps and commands.
- **Verify** — success criteria and dashboards to check.
- **Artifacts** — logs/exports to capture under `output/`.
- **Rollback** — safe, minimal reversal steps.
