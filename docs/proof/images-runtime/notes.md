# Images (Runtime) — Proof Pack Notes
_Last updated: 2025-09-22T00:00Z_

- **Proves:** Runtime‑built **Packer** images (Windows + control node) published for fast failover/provisioning.
- **Verify:** Link **CI run + artifact** and **Blob/GCS** listings with checksums.
- **Evidence included:** Template path, vars, post‑processors, upload targets; artifact IDs/checksums.
- **KPIs mapped:** Supports DR RTO/RPO by shortening provisioning.

# Runtime Images — Proof Pack Notes
_Last updated: 2025-09-22 00:00 UTC_

**Proves:** Runtime-built Packer images (Windows + control node) published for fast failover/provisioning.

**Verify:** Use the CI run, template path, and storage listings in `./links.txt`. Confirm artifact IDs and checksums match.

**Artifacts (./images/):** `packer_success.png`, `artifact_listing_blob.png` (and/or `artifact_listing_gcs.png`)

**KPI tie-in:** Supports DR objectives (faster reprovisioning → RTO/RPO).
