# Global Talent – Referees Brief (Working Doc)

This note defines the **three referees** I plan to use for my Tech Nation Global Talent application, the angle each will cover, and which evidence slots they reinforce.

The goal is to give each referee a **clear, honest brief** so their letters are specific, complementary, and aligned with the criteria (MC, OC1, OC2).

---

## 1. Referee overview

### Referee 1 – Academic (University of East London)

- **Profile:** Lecturer/supervisor/HoD who can speak to my performance and potential during the BSc Computer Science.
- **Angle:** Academic excellence, early innovation, and evidence that I operate above “typical graduate” level.
- **Criteria focus:**  
  - **Mandatory Criterion (MC)** – exceptional promise in digital tech.  
  - Supporting **OC1** (technical innovation) via my final-year project.

**Key points to highlight:**

- I achieved a **first-class BSc in Computer Science** at UEL.
- I received a **departmental award for outstanding engagement**.
- My final-year project was ranked in the **top 15 of 120** students.
- Brief description of the project (*Network Automation and Abstraction*) and why it stood out (automation, abstraction, quality of implementation).
- Evidence that I am **self-directed, intellectually curious** and capable of handling complex technical work independently.

**Relevant evidence slots:**

- **MC – Slot 1 / 2** (academic excellence & early innovation).  
- Personal statement – Section 1 (Foundation).

### Referee 2 – Network Manager (The Latymer School)

- **Profile:** Network Manager / line manager who supervised my work as IT Technician.
- **Angle:** Real-world impact, reliability, initiative, and how I brought a platform/automation mindset into a live school environment.
- **Criteria focus:**  
  - **Mandatory Criterion (MC)** – impact and leadership potential.  
  - Optional support towards **OC3** (contributions in employment), even if we don’t formally claim OC3.

**Key points to highlight:**

- My role as an **IT Technician with system administration responsibilities**.
- The **PowerShell user-profile cleanup script**:
  - Why the problem mattered (storage pressure, corrupted profiles, lesson disruption).
  - How I analysed the pattern and proposed a scripted, safe solution.
  - Their approval and rollout across labs and laptops.
  - Approximate scale: **six computer labs, ~64 student laptops, ~100 staff laptops, ~1,500 profiles** touched over time.
- Any other examples of:
  - Reliability, ownership of tickets end-to-end.
  - Contribution to the Windows 10 → 11 rollout / imaging.
  - Early thinking around **device de-boarding** and lifecycle.

**Relevant evidence slots:**

- **MC – Slot 2** (real-world impact, early career).  
- **Support for Slot 9** – “Real-World Contributions in Employed Roles (Latymer)”.

### Referee 3 – Industry / Platform & Community Angle

- **Profile:** Senior engineer / architect / manager in UK digital tech who can speak to:
  - My platform engineering mindset (HybridOps.Studio).
  - Documentation and teaching approach.
  - Open-source / community potential.
- **Angle:** HybridOps.Studio as a serious, reusable platform blueprint; my ability to think about cost, DR, reliability, and documentation together; and my potential impact in UK teams and community.
- **Criteria focus:**  
  - **MC:** overall calibre and platform thinking.  
  - **OC1:** innovation in building hybrid platform / DR / cost-aware automation.  
  - **OC2:** public impact through docs, Academy, and future content.

**Key points to highlight:**

- That they have reviewed or discussed **HybridOps.Studio** with me and see it as:
  - A coherent hybrid platform blueprint (network, NetBox, Kubernetes, DR, cost, docs).
  - Run to a level that resembles a small platform/SRE product, not a toy lab.
- My emphasis on:
  - **Source of truth–driven automation** (NetBox, Terraform, Ansible).
  - **Cost-aware DR** and Prometheus/GitHub Actions orchestration.
  - **Documentation and teaching** (docs.hybridops.studio, Academy structure).
- My potential to contribute to:
  - Platform / SRE teams in the UK.
  - The wider community via documentation, future talks, Ansible Galaxy collections, and Academy content.

**Relevant evidence slots:**

- **OC1 – Slots 3, 4, 5** (hybrid network, NetBox, DR & cost).  
- **OC2 – Slots 6, 7, 8** (public docs, Academy, future content).  
- Support for **Slot 10** (Galaxy downloads / adoption, once numbers are ready).

## 2. Instructions for referees (what to ask for)

Each letter should ideally:

1. Be on **official letterhead**, signed, with contact details.  
2. Be **1–3 pages**, but focused rather than generic.  
3. Cover:

   - **Who they are** (role, organisation, seniority).  
   - **How they know me** (context, duration, nature of relationship).  
   - **Why they believe I meet Tech Nation’s “exceptional promise” bar**, with concrete examples.  
   - Specific references to:
     - My **technical ability** and potential.
     - My **ownership / leadership behaviours**.
     - Any **evidence** they have seen: projects, docs, repos, scripts, presentations, initiative.

4. Where possible, mention **impact**:
   - For academic: rankings, distinctions, level of work vs peers.  
   - For Latymer: scale (labs, users, devices), reduction in incidents, reliability.  
   - For industry / platform: quality of design, realism of HybridOps.Studio, clarity of docs.

I will not ask any referee to exaggerate or misrepresent anything. The brief exists only to help them focus on the **most relevant facts** for the Global Talent criteria.

## 3. Practical checklist (for me)

- [ ] Confirm each referee is willing and able to provide a detailed letter.  
- [ ] Share this brief + Tech Nation guidelines with them.  
- [ ] Offer bullet points / links to relevant evidence (FYP repo, Latymer script, HybridOps.Studio docs).  
- [ ] Set a clear deadline (ideally **2–4 weeks** before submission).  
- [ ] Check final letters for factual accuracy (no ghost-writing, just correctness).  
- [ ] Save as PDFs and reference them in the **cover sheet** and evidence slots.
