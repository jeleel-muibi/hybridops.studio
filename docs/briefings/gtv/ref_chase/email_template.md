Subject: Request for Tech Nation Global Talent reference letter

Dear [Name],

I hope you’re well.

I’m applying for the UK Global Talent visa in digital technology (Tech Nation route) and I would be honoured if you could provide a reference letter in support of my application.

The assessors are looking for evidence that I show strong potential as a future technical leader. From your perspective, this would mostly relate to my time at the University of East London, including:

- My performance on the BSc Computer Science (first-class degree).
- The departmental award for outstanding engagement.
- My final-year project on network automation & abstraction (top 15 of 120 projects) and why it stood out technically or academically.

Tech Nation asks for a letter on headed paper, signed, ideally 1–3 pages. I’ve put together a short “referees brief” with the formal requirements and some suggested points you might choose to comment on – I’m happy to share that, and of course you should feel free to ignore anything that doesn’t match your view.

If you’re comfortable with this, I can send:

- A link to my project repository.
- A short summary of how my current platform work (HybridOps.Studio) builds on that foundation.

Please let me know if you’d be willing to support me with this and if there is any information you’d like from me to make it easier.

Kind regards,  
Jeleel

Hi [Name],

I hope you’re doing well.

I’m applying for the UK Global Talent visa in digital technology (Tech Nation route) and would really value a reference letter from you based on our work together at The Latymer School.

The assessors are looking for evidence that I can contribute at a high level in real environments. From your perspective, that would mainly be:

- My role as an IT Technician with system administration responsibilities.
- The profile cleanup script (PowerShell) – why the problem mattered, how we tested and rolled it out, and its impact across labs and staff/student devices.
- Any other examples you feel reflect my initiative, reliability and long-term thinking (for example the Windows 10→11 rollout or early work on device de-boarding).

Tech Nation asks for 1–3 pages on headed paper with your role, organisation and contact details. I’ve drafted a short “referees brief” showing the formal requirements and a few suggested angles, which I can share to make this easier – but of course the content should be in your own words.

If you’re happy to help, I can also send:

- A reminder of the script details and where it fits.
- A short summary of how this connects to my broader platform work (HybridOps.Studio).

Please let me know if you’d be willing to provide a letter and what timescales would work for you.

Thanks again for all your support,  
Jeleel

Subject: Request for Tech Nation Global Talent reference letter

Hi [Name],

I hope you’re well.

I’m applying for the UK Global Talent visa in digital technology (Tech Nation route) and I was wondering if you would be willing to provide a reference letter based on your view of my platform and documentation work.

In particular, Tech Nation is looking for evidence that I show strong potential as a future technical leader. From your perspective, that could cover areas such as:

- My work on **HybridOps.Studio** as a hybrid platform blueprint (networking, NetBox as source of truth, Kubernetes, DR and cost-aware automation).
- The way I approach **documentation and teaching** (docs.hybridops.studio, ADRs, HOWTOs, runbooks, Academy structure).
- Any conversations or reviews we’ve had that show how I think about reliability, DR, cost, and making complex systems understandable to others.

The formal requirements are:

- 1–3 pages on letterhead, signed, with your role, organisation and contact details.
- A clear statement of how you know me and how long you’ve known my work.
- Your view on my potential and impact in the UK tech ecosystem.

I have a short “referees brief” that summarises this and links to the relevant parts of my work. I’m happy to send that over, along with links to the repositories and docs you might want to refer to.

Please let me know if this is something you’d be comfortable doing, and if so, what kind of deadline would be reasonable for you.

Best regards,  
Jeleel
