Academic (UEL)

Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.

Here’s a short summary to make the Tech Nation expectations clearer and to give you some context for what might be most helpful to mention.

Tech Nation is looking for evidence that I show strong potential as a future technical leader. From your perspective, the most relevant points are:

- I graduated with a **first-class BSc in Computer Science** at UEL.
- I received a **departmental award for outstanding engagement**.
- My final-year project (*Network Automation and Abstraction*) was ranked in the **top 15 of 120** projects.
- Why that project stood out (e.g. quality of implementation, approach to automation/abstraction, independence, problem-solving).
- Any observations about my ability to handle complex technical material, work independently and go beyond the minimum requirements.

The formal Tech Nation requirements are:
- 1–3 pages on UEL letterhead, signed.
- Your role and department, and how you know me.
- Your view on my ability and potential in digital technology.

Useful links:
- Final-year project repo: [link to GitHub]
- HybridOps.Studio overview repo: [link to GitHub]
- Short CV/resume for context: [link or attachment]

Please feel free to ignore anything that doesn’t match your view – your honest perspective is what matters.

Latymer Network Manager

Thank you again for agreeing to help – I really appreciate it.

To make this easier, here’s a short summary of the key things that would be most useful for Tech Nation to hear from you.

From your perspective, the important points are:

- My role as an **IT Technician with system administration responsibilities** at The Latymer School.
- The **PowerShell user profile cleanup script**:
  - The original problem (storage pressure, corrupted profiles, login issues).
  - How we tested it and rolled it out (apps server, GPO, labs → wider use).
  - The scale: six computer labs, ~64 student laptops, ~100 staff laptops, touching around **1,500 profiles** over time.
- Any other examples you feel reflect my initiative and reliability:
  - Contribution to the Windows 10 → 11 rollout / imaging.
  - Thinking around an automated **device de-boarding** process.
- Your view of how I approached the role (ownership, care for users, long-term thinking rather than quick fixes).

Tech Nation asks for:
- 1–3 pages on school letterhead, signed.
- Your role, how you supervised my work, and over what period.
- Specific examples of where you saw me having impact or taking initiative.

Useful links:
- Short summary of the script and how it works: [internal doc or brief you prepare]
- HybridOps.Studio overview (to show how my thinking is evolving): [GitHub link]
- Short CV/resume for context: [link or attachment]

Of course, please only include what you’re comfortable stating in your own words – this is just to make sure I don’t waste your time guessing what the assessors are looking for.

Industry / platform referee

Thank you so much for being willing to support this.

Here’s a short summary of what would be most useful to mention from your perspective.

Tech Nation is looking for evidence that I have strong potential as a future technical leader in digital technology. From your angle, the useful points are:

- Your impression of **HybridOps.Studio** as a hybrid platform blueprint:
  - Hybrid network and WAN edge.
  - NetBox as a source of truth feeding automation.
  - Kubernetes / RKE2, DR and cost-aware orchestration.
- My approach to **documentation and teaching**:
  - ADRs, HOWTOs, runbooks and proof artefacts.
  - `docs.hybridops.studio` and the way it targets different audiences.
  - The idea of HybridOps Academy and why it could be useful to teams.
- Any examples (from conversations or reviews) of:
  - How I think about reliability, DR, cost and observability.
  - How I explain complex systems or trade-offs clearly.
- Your view on how I could contribute to a UK platform/SRE team or the wider community.

Tech Nation asks for:
- 1–3 pages on letterhead with your role, organisation and contact details.
- A clear statement of how you know me and what you’ve seen of my work.
- Your honest view on my ability and potential impact in the UK tech ecosystem.

Useful links:
- HybridOps.Studio repo: [GitHub link]
- Docs portal: [https://docs.hybridops.studio](https://docs.hybridops.studio)
- GTV evidence overview (so you can see how I’m framing everything): [link to gtv/README or cover sheet]

This is just a guide – please feel free to ignore anything that doesn’t reflect your own experience.
