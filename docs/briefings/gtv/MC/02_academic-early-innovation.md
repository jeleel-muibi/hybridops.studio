# Evidence Slot 2 – Academic Excellence & Early Innovation (MC)

> **Criteria:** Mandatory Criterion (MC) – recognised as a potential leader in digital technology.  
> **Scope:** Academic foundation (first-class degree, departmental award) and early innovation in network automation.  
> **Note (working copy only):** `[IMG-XX]` placeholders will be replaced with final artefacts (certificate crops, repo screenshots) before submission.

## 1. Context – Why This Evidence Matters

This evidence shows the **academic foundation and early innovation** behind HybridOps.Studio.

- A **first-class BSc in Computer Science** demonstrates strong fundamentals in algorithms, systems and networking.  
- A **departmental award for outstanding engagement** shows I was already contributing beyond the minimum, supporting others and engaging with the wider department.  
- A **final-year project in network automation and abstraction**, ranked in the **top 15 of 120** projects, shows an early commitment to the same themes that HybridOps.Studio now develops at a much more advanced, production-style level.

Together, these elements support the Mandatory Criteria for **Exceptional Promise**: I have been operating at a high level from the beginning of my career and have consistently invested in the skills that underpin HybridOps.Studio.

## 2. First-Class BSc in Computer Science

I completed a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** with **First Class Honours**.

- Strong performance across core modules such as:
  - Operating Systems and Networks  
  - Databases and Distributed Systems  
  - Software Engineering and Algorithms  
- Consistent high grades across the degree, not just in isolated modules.

This academic record matters for two reasons:

1. It shows that I have a **solid theoretical foundation** for the systems I am now building in HybridOps.Studio (networking, distributed systems, security, databases).  
2. It supports the **Exceptional Promise** route, where Tech Nation explicitly considers strong academic performance as part of the evidence of future leadership potential.

In addition to the degree itself, I have continued structured learning beyond university, including:

- Microsoft **AZ-104 – Azure Administrator** exam preparation.  
- Cisco-aligned networking training (**CCNA-level** skills).  
- IBM training in **Cybersecurity** and **Enterprise Security in Practice**.

Alongside formal study, I have been an **active member of the British Computer Society (BCS)** since my student days, using BCS resources and events to stay aligned with professional standards in software, networking and infrastructure engineering.

These certifications, trainings and professional memberships are **supporting signals**: the main story is what I have built with that knowledge (HybridOps.Studio), but they show that I have consistently invested in my development and stayed close to industry best practices.

## 3. Departmental Award for Outstanding Engagement

During my degree I received a **departmental award for outstanding engagement**.

[IMG-02 – Award certificate or official email confirming departmental award – ~6 lines]

This award recognises that I:

- Consistently engaged with lecturers and peers.  
- Contributed positively to the department’s learning environment.  
- Went beyond what was required in terms of participation and support.

It is relevant for the Mandatory Criteria because it shows early evidence that I was already:

- Seen as someone who contributed beyond their own grades.  
- Building the soft skills – communication, collaboration, initiative – that are essential for leading technical work later.

HybridOps.Studio’s documentation, academy design and teaching orientation build on this same mindset: **make complex systems understandable and reusable for others**.

## 4. Final-Year Project – Network Automation & Abstraction

My final-year project (FYP) focused on **network automation and abstraction**, the same themes that now underpin HybridOps.Studio.

- The project implemented:
  - An abstraction layer over network configuration.  
  - Automated workflows for provisioning and updating network devices.  
- It was assessed by the department as one of the **top 15 projects out of 120** in the cohort.

[ART-01 – Small snippet of architecture diagram or code fragment from the FYP – ~6 lines]

This project was important for two reasons:

1. It was my **first serious attempt** at treating networking as software: using abstraction, automation and repeatability instead of purely manual configuration.  
2. It validated, through the department’s ranking, that the project was not only technically interesting but also well-executed compared to my peers.

At the time, the scope was limited to a student context: a constrained lab environment and simplified use cases. HybridOps.Studio takes the same core ideas and extends them into a **hybrid on-prem + cloud platform** with DR, cost-aware automation, and an embedded documentation and academy layer.

## 5. From FYP to HybridOps.Studio – Continuity of Themes

HybridOps.Studio is not a random side project; it is a **direct continuation and professionalisation** of the ideas explored in my final-year project.

- **Then (FYP):**
  - Network automation and abstraction in a student lab setting.  
  - Basic automated configuration of network devices.  
  - Single environment, limited scale.

- **Now (HybridOps.Studio):**
  - Full **hybrid network** design with dual ISP and WAN edge.  
  - NetBox-based **source of truth** for network and infrastructure.  
  - Automated provisioning using Terraform, Ansible and Nornir.  
  - **Disaster recovery and cost-aware workflows** driven by Prometheus and GitHub Actions.  
  - A complete **documentation and academy engine** with ADRs, HOWTOs, runbooks and showcases.

This continuity demonstrates:

- Long-term focus on **network automation, abstraction and platform thinking**.  
- A clear trajectory from **high-performing student** → **engineer building an integrated platform with DR, cost, and teaching**.  

This is precisely the kind of trajectory Tech Nation looks for in **Exceptional Promise** candidates: someone who has shown talent early and has scaled that talent into more ambitious, more impactful work.

## 6. How This Supports the Mandatory Criteria

Taken together, this evidence shows that:

- I have a **strong academic base** in computer science, validated by a first-class degree.  
- I was recognised by my department for **outstanding engagement**, not just grades.  
- I undertook an **innovative, highly ranked final-year project** in network automation and abstraction that laid the groundwork for HybridOps.Studio.  
- I have continued to deepen my expertise through further training (Azure, Cisco-level networking, IBM cybersecurity) and by maintaining professional alignment through BCS membership.  
- I have applied this knowledge in a much more ambitious platform (HybridOps.Studio) that unifies hybrid networking, automation, DR, cost awareness and documentation.

In combination with the separate evidence that describes HybridOps.Studio itself, this supports the Mandatory Criteria by demonstrating that:

- I have been operating at a **high level from the start of my career**, and  
- My current work is part of a **coherent, long-term trajectory** towards leadership in hybrid infrastructure, automation and platform engineering.
