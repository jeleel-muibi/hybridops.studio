Priority HOWTOs
----------------
1) HOWTO: Configure Dual Uplink (Ethernet/WiFi) on Proxmox
   - Audience: Homelab and platform engineers.
   - Scope: WiFi driver/firmware, wpa_supplicant, /etc/network/interfaces layout, validation.
   - References: ADR-0105, docs/prerequisites/network-architecture.md, ethernet-wifi-failover runbook.

2) HOWTO: Implement VLAN-Aware Bridge and VLAN Subinterfaces on Proxmox
   - Audience: Networking and platform engineers.
   - Scope: vmbr0 creation, bridge-vlan-aware, vmbr0.<vlan> gateways, validation commands.
   - References: ADR-0101, ADR-0102, Add VLAN Gateway runbook.

3) HOWTO: Configure Inter-VLAN Firewall Baseline with iptables
   - Audience: Security and platform engineers.
   - Scope: Translating ADR-0103 policy matrix into iptables rules, persistence, dry-run in staging.
   - References: ADR-0103, firewall-baseline runbook.

4) HOWTO: Build Static IP Allocation with Terraform IPAM
   - Audience: Terraform practitioners.
   - Scope: IPAM module design, allocations map, gateway outputs, integration with Proxmox VM module and cloud-init.
   - References: ADR-0104, infra/terraform/modules/proxmox/ipam (once implemented).

5) HOWTO: Deploy Observability Stack (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki) in VLAN 11
   - Audience: SRE / observability engineers.
   - Scope: VM layout, scrape configs per environment, firewall rules, sample dashboards.
   - References: ADR-0401, ADR-0103.

6) HOWTO: Bootstrap EVE-NG Network Lab in VLAN 50
   - Audience: Network engineers.
   - Scope: EVE-NG VM provisioning, VLAN 50 isolation, optional trunking for hybrid scenarios.
   - References: ADR-0201, ADR-0103.

7) HOWTO: Add a New Environment (e.g. QA) to the VLAN Scheme
   - Audience: Platform / networking engineers.
   - Scope: Extending VLAN ranges, updating ADR-0101, Proxmox interfaces, firewall matrix, IPAM ranges.

8) HOWTO: Validate Network Architecture End-to-End
   - Audience: Assessors, SREs, platform engineers.
   - Scope: Systematic checklist to verify routing, NAT, firewall, observability, and lab isolation using the topology diagram.

Notes
-----
- Runbooks above should stay terse and incident-focused; these HOWTOs carry the teaching narrative and deeper rationale.
- All HOWTOs should use the standard HOWTO template (docs/howtos/HOWTO_template.md) and cross-link back to ADRs.
