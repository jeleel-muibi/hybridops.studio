# HybridOps.Studio â€” HOWTO Library

> This directory contains educational, reproducible HOWTOs that complement the operational runbooks under `docs/runbooks/`.  
> Each HOWTO is designed to teach â€” not just execute â€” and often pairs with YouTube videos, live demos, or guided workshops.

## ðŸ§­ Relation to Runbooks

- Each HOWTO links to at least one **Runbook** for its operational equivalent.  
- Runbooks are **machine-actionable**; HOWTOs are **human-readable**.  
- Together, they form the **HybridOps Knowledge Loop** â€” *learn â†’ run â†’ verify â†’ document.*
