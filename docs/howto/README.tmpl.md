# HOWTOs — Task-Oriented Guides

HOWTOs describe concrete tasks in HybridOps.Studio: build images, provision infrastructure, configure services, validate DR, and operate the platform day to day.

Each HOWTO focuses on a single workflow and is written to be reproducible from a clean starting point. Where relevant, it links to ADRs, runbooks, and proof artefacts so implementation and reasoning stay connected.

> Access flags (`public`, `academy`, `mixed`) follow the documentation access model in [ADR-0021](../adr/ADR-0021-docs-access-model.md).

## Using these HOWTOs

If you are working through the platform as an engineer:

- Start with image build and platform bootstrap topics.
- Move on to burst, DR, and observability once the base platform is healthy.
- Use links into runbooks and ADRs when you need deeper operational or design context.

If you are reviewing HybridOps.Studio (for example as an assessor or hiring manager), the index below gives a structured view of how the platform is operated in practice, including which areas are taught in HybridOps Academy.
