Project-wide showcase catalogue for HybridOps.Studio. Each showcase tells an end-to-end story, combining:

- Architecture and design highlights.
- Demo video and screenshots.
- Links to source code, infrastructure as code, and proof artefacts.

These pages are intended for assessors, hiring managers, learners, and engineering leaders who want to see how the blueprint behaves in practice.
