# ADR-0100: HPC Extension Strategy for HybridOps.Studio

## Context
HybridOps.Studio currently focuses on hybrid infrastructure automation across on-prem and cloud environments, with strong emphasis on networking, observability, and failover. As scientific workloads and AI/ML pipelines become more prevalent, there is a strategic opportunity to extend the platform to support High Performance Computing (HPC) use cases. This would involve integrating Slurm as a job scheduler and simulating HPC clusters within the existing architecture.

## Decision
Explore the integration of Slurm-based HPC workloads into HybridOps.Studio in future phases. This extension will be modular and scoped to lab-scale emulation using virtualized compute nodes. The goal is to demonstrate job scheduling, resource allocation, and DevOps practices in HPC environments without requiring physical supercomputing infrastructure.

## Consequences
- Positive: Expands the scope of HybridOps.Studio to include scientific computing; showcases versatility and forward-thinking architecture.
- Negative: Adds complexity to the platform; requires additional tooling and documentation.
- Neutral/unknowns: Performance limits of virtualized HPC emulation; community support for Slurm in hybrid setups.

## Alternatives considered
1. Ignore HPC use cases — limits the platform’s relevance to scientific and research domains.
2. Use Kubernetes batch jobs instead of Slurm — simpler but less representative of real-world HPC environments.

## Implementation notes
- Deploy Slurm controller and compute nodes in Proxmox or EVE-NG.
- Use Ansible or Nornir to automate Slurm configuration.
- Integrate with existing observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana).
- Evaluate feasibility and performance quarterly; document findings in future ADRs.
