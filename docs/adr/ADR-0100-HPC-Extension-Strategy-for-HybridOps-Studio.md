# ADR-0100 — HPC Extension Strategy for HybridOps.Studio

## Status
Proposed — a forward-looking design to extend the HybridOps.Studio control plane toward **HPC (High-Performance Computing)** workloads and research environments.

## Context
HybridOps.Studio currently focuses on hybrid enterprise automation — connecting on-premises clusters, CI/CD pipelines, and public clouds.  
However, demand for compute-intensive data analysis, AI model training, and simulation workflows is growing rapidly across enterprise and academic sectors.

To remain future-ready, the platform must support **HPC-style workloads** (MPI, SLURM, CUDA, large-memory nodes) without compromising its reproducibility and DevOps governance model.

## Problem Statement
Traditional HPC systems rely on tightly coupled infrastructure and bespoke schedulers.  
HybridOps aims to introduce a **DevOps-style abstraction** for HPC:  
reproducible environment provisioning, controlled scaling, and consistent logging under existing CI/CD governance.

## Decision
Introduce a **modular HPC extension layer** leveraging existing HybridOps primitives.

### Design Highlights
- **Scheduler:** Integrate SLURM within a dedicated “HPC cluster” namespace.  
- **Compute nodes:** Provisioned dynamically via Terraform + Ansible on dedicated Proxmox or cloud instances.  
- **Workload packaging:** Use containerized job runners (Apptainer/Singularity).  
- **Networking:** High-speed vSwitch or VLAN-backed NICs (SR-IOV optional).  
- **Storage:** Shared NFS or CephFS mounted under `/mnt/hpc-data`.  
- **Observability:** Prometheus HPC exporter integrated into global federation.  
- **Governance:** Same “Environment Guard” rules applied to HPC pipelines for auditability.

### Roadmap Phases
1. **Prototype** — deploy single-rack SLURM cluster using HybridOps provisioning (target: Q1 2026).  
2. **Integration** — add job submission from Jenkins pipelines (evidence-driven).  
3. **Federation** — connect on-prem HPC to cloud burst nodes (GCP Preemptible or Azure Spot).  
4. **Governance** — enforce RTO/RPO and audit alignment with existing control plane.

## Consequences
- ✅ Expands HybridOps.Studio use cases into HPC/AI workloads.  
- ✅ Demonstrates infrastructure scalability for enterprise research environments.  
- ✅ Aligns DevOps and scientific computing governance under one platform.  
- ⚠️ Increases complexity — requires new monitoring and cost controls.  
- ⚠️ Not all HPC workloads will suit containerized scheduling initially.
