# ADR Process & Conventions

---

## Context
HybridOps.Studio is a broad, multi-domain portfolio. Architectural decisions should be recorded in a durable, reviewable format that is easy for assessors and contributors to navigate.

## Decision
Adopt lightweight **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** with:
- **Sequential numbering**: `ADR-0001_*`, `ADR-0002_*`, …
- **Status lifecycle**: `Proposed` → `Accepted` → `Superseded`/`Rejected`.
- **Single-decision-per-file**, concise (1–2 pages), public-friendly language.
- **Cross-linking** to evidence, runbooks, and code paths.

## Rationale
- Keeps context and trade-offs discoverable over time.
- Helps assessors understand *why* a baseline was chosen over alternatives.
- Avoids decision drift across repos and showcases.

## Consequences
- Small upfront writing cost; significant long-term clarity.
- Requires discipline to supersede older ADRs when direction changes.

## Implementation
- Place files under `adr/` with the format: `ADR-XXXX_short-slug.md`.
- Include sections: **Context, Decision, Rationale, Consequences, Alternatives (optional), Verification (optional), Links**.
- Update `adr/README.md` with each new ADR (number, title, status, date).
