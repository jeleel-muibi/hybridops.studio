# ADR-0001 — ADR Process & Conventions

## Status
Accepted — Defines the formal approach to documenting architecture decisions within HybridOps.Studio.

## Context
As HybridOps.Studio grows into a multi-domain automation framework (platform, networking, observability, governance), design decisions must be traceable, consistent, and evidence-backed.  
Without a structured ADR process, future contributors and assessors may find it difficult to follow the reasoning behind architectural changes.

## Decision
Adopt a lightweight, Git-based **Architecture Decision Record (ADR)** framework modeled after [Michael Nygard’s format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions.html), enhanced with:
- YAML front matter for machine-readable metadata (used by ADR index generators)
- Markdown body with clear sectioning (Context, Decision, Consequences, References)
- Automated indexing (`make adr.index`) for repository-wide discoverability
- Cross-links to runbooks, diagrams, and evidence

Each ADR file is immutable once accepted; any change requires a superseding ADR.

## Options Considered

- **Ad‑hoc notes or wiki pages** — rejected; difficult to automate or trace.
- **Lightweight markdown ADRs (chosen)** — readable, diff‑friendly, and easily integrated with CI/CD pipelines.

## Consequences
- All major decisions will be reviewable via Git history.
- Cross-references in documentation and runbooks remain consistent.
- Enables assessors, maintainers, and new contributors to follow architectural reasoning without ambiguity.
