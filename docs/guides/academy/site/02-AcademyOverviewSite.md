# HybridOps Academy

HybridOps Academy provides structured, practice-focused training built on the HybridOps.Studio platform.  
It is designed for practitioners who want to work with real hybrid-cloud operations, not isolated lab fragments.

The same codebase, runbooks, and proof artefacts that underpin the public portfolio are used as the foundation for the Academy.

## What HybridOps Academy offers

HybridOps Academy focuses on three things:

- **Hybrid operations skills**  
  Working across on-prem (for example Proxmox, VMware) and public cloud (Azure, GCP, selected AWS scenarios) with image-based builds, Infrastructure as Code, configuration management, and CI/CD.

- **Disaster recovery and resilience**  
  Designing, running, and proving failover and failback patterns, using documented runbooks and real evidence.

- **Network-aware automation**  
  Treating connectivity, routing, and multi-vendor networking as first-class parts of the automation story, not an afterthought.

Training is delivered against the actual HybridOps.Studio repository and documentation, so learners see the same patterns that are available for review by assessors and hiring managers.

## Flagship programme: HybridOps Architect

The flagship programme is a six-week, cohort-based course:

- **Format**  
  Live sessions, guided labs, and structured use of the HybridOps.Studio repository.

- **Scope**  
  - Hybrid infrastructure (on-prem plus cloud).  
  - Packer, Terraform, Terragrunt, and Ansible.  
  - CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub Actions.  
  - Observability and decision logic using Prometheus federation.  
  - DR drills and failback, with corresponding proof artefacts.  

- **Outcome**  
  By the end of the programme, participants will have run full end-to-end flows (for example DR scenarios and platform bootstrap) and produced their own evidence bundles that can be incorporated into personal or internal portfolios.

## Specialist labs and tracks

In addition to the flagship programme, HybridOps Academy is being expanded with focused labs and tracks that reuse the same platform:

- **Network automation and multi-vendor WAN**  
  Using EVE-NG, Nornir, Ansible, and multi-vendor devices to validate routing, failover, and VPN designs.

- **GitOps and Kubernetes operations**  
  Using Argo CD and/or Flux with RKE2/AKS/GKE, integrating observability and rollback patterns.

- **Polyglot Infrastructure as Code**  
  Deep dives into Terraform and Terragrunt, with selected Pulumi scenarios where a code-driven approach is appropriate.

- **Certification-aligned practice**  
  Using HybridOps.Studio as a realistic environment to support preparation for network, cloud, and Kubernetes-oriented certifications.

A high-level roadmap for these labs and tracks is maintained in the documentation:

## How delivery works

HybridOps Academy is designed to be practical and predictable:

- **Mode**  
  - Live online sessions for teaching and discussion.  
  - Guided labs and runbooks using the HybridOps.Studio repository.  
  - Access to documentation and, for some programmes, additional Academy-only notes.

- **Artefacts**  
  Participants produce tangible outputs such as runbooks, Terraform and Ansible runs, connectivity tests, and DR drill evidence. These can be reused for internal reporting or as part of a personal portfolio.

- **Environment**  
  Where possible, learners use their own homelab or cloud accounts so that patterns can be adapted to local realities. For some programmes, prepared environments may be provided.

Details of format, expectations, and environment preparation are described in the Academy documentation.

## Who the Academy is for

HybridOps Academy is aimed at:

- Practitioners in DevOps, SRE, cloud, or networking roles who want realistic hybrid operations experience.  
- Engineers preparing for more senior or architect-level positions and needing a credible portfolio.  
- Teams piloting or refining hybrid operations who want structured guidance.

The Academy is not targeted at complete beginners. A baseline familiarity with Linux, Git, and at least one automation or cloud tool is expected.
