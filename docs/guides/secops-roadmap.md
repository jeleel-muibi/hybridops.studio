# SecOps Roadmap â€” HybridOps.Studio

**Scope:** Planned security & operations maturity upgrades tracked as a roadmap. Status: âœ… done Â· ðŸ”„ inâ€‘progress Â· ðŸŸ¡ planned.

## Now â†’ Next â†’ Later
- **Now (inâ€‘progress):** RBAC & secrets, centralized config
- **Next (planned):** changeâ€‘management hooks, notifications
- **Later (planned):** full audit trail, periodic reviews

## 1) RBAC & Secret Management
- Enforce role separation for sensitive actions (e.g., production deploys). ðŸŸ¡
- Store secrets with Ansible Vault or external KMS (e.g., Azure Key Vault). ðŸ”„
- Optional: integrate with enterprise identity (AD/LDAP/Okta). ðŸŸ¡

## 2) Centralized, Versioned Configuration
- Maintain environment and policy settings in versioned YAML/JSON. ðŸ”„
- Load configuration at runtime only; no hardâ€‘coding in playbooks. ðŸŸ¡
- Track changes for auditability. ðŸŸ¡

## 3) Changeâ€‘Management Hooks
- Require valid change tickets (Jira/ServiceNow) for production actions. ðŸŸ¡
- Link deployments to tickets for traceability via API integration. ðŸŸ¡

## 4) Automated Notifications
- Alerts for deploys, approvals, and failures (Slack/email/PagerDuty). ðŸŸ¡
- Retain notification history for compliance. ðŸŸ¡

## 5) Audit & Compliance
- Immutable logs for deployments, approvals, and justifications. ðŸŸ¡
- Periodic reviews and exportable reports for stakeholders. ðŸŸ¡

## Alignment Today
- Placeholder inventories and pipeline gates limit exposure of sensitive data. âœ…
- Governance stages (environment validation, host selection) support segregation of duties. âœ…
- Observability (Prometheus/Grafana) enables SLOâ€‘driven decisioning and incident response. âœ…

## Milestones & Acceptance
- **RBAC & secrets operational** (reviewed by peer).
- **Config versioning enforced** across environments.
- **Change hooks & notifications live** in CI/CD.
- **Audit trail retention defined** and verified.
