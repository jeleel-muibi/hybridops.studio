# HybridOps.Studio — Contracting & Capability Statement

> **Hybrid, multi-cloud automation — delivered.**  
> London-based (remote-friendly). Available for focused sprints or longer programmes.

## What I Do

- **Hybrid infra & DR** — Proxmox ↔ Azure/GCP design and implementation; Google NCC hub-and-spoke; SQL read-only and DR patterns.
- **Kubernetes at scale** — Control-plane hardening, burst-to-cloud workers, GitOps-ready clusters.
- **Network automation** — Multi-vendor (Cisco, Arista, Fortinet, pfSense) with BGP/OSPF/VRRP/HSRP/CARP/STP.
- **IaC & pipelines** — Terraform, Terragrunt, Ansible, Packer (runtime images), Jenkins and GitHub Actions.
- **Observability & SRE** — Prometheus federation, Grafana, alerting/webhooks; SLO policies and decision services.

## Why Teams Hire Me

- **Outcome-focused** — DR and recovery objectives defined up front, with autoscale and DR triggers tied to KPIs.
- **Vendor-neutral** — Designs that work across clouds and on-prem without unnecessary lock-in.
- **Product-led** — Reusable hybrid blueprint (not a one-off lab), fully scripted and testable.
- **Secure-by-default** — Segmentation, secrets handling, and auditable pipelines as first-class concerns.

## Example Engagements

- **Resilient Hybrid Launch (4–8 weeks)** — NCC hub, Prometheus federation, read-only database in cloud, DR runbook and drill.
- **Burst-to-Cloud Enablement (2–4 weeks)** — Kubernetes burst workers in Azure/GCP with policy-driven decision hooks.
- **Pipeline Modernisation (2–3 weeks)** — Packer images, Terraform/Terragrunt, GitHub Actions/Jenkins hardening.
- **Network Automation Sprint (2–3 weeks)** — EVE-NG sub-sites → production-ready configs, CI checks, and guardrails.

## Deliverables

- Architecture overview diagrams and runbooks.
- Terraform/Ansible/Packer code, pipelines and tests.
- Grafana dashboards and alert policies.
- Evidence packs mapped to KPIs (for stakeholders and auditors).
